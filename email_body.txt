With a solid background in system design, a full software development life cycle, and proficiency in a wide range of programming languages and technologies,  I am excited about the prospect of contributing to innovative projects and driving technological advancements.

I have around 5 years of non-internship professional software development experience. I worked at General Electric for around 3 years and at Wipro Limited for around 2 years. During my tenure at General Electric, I had more than 2 years of experience in system design and architecture. Apart from that, I also have 3+ years of full software development life cycle, including coding standards, code reviews, source control management, build processes, testing, and operations experience.
